### Question:
How does inflation affect interest rates and the broader market?

### Model Used:
`gpt-4.1` (Reasoning-tuned)

### Response:
Example 1:
{
  "possible_explanation": "Real wage erosion",
  "mechanism": "Prices rise faster than nominal pay, reducing purchasing power.",
  "impact_on_wages": "Real wages fall until wage growth catches up.",
  "time_frame": "Immediate term",
  "economic_context": "Inflation spikes with weak indexation or slack labor markets."
}

Example 2:
{
  "possible_explanation": "Wage catch-up effect",
  "mechanism": "Cost-of-living adjustments and bargaining raise nominal pay to track prices.",
  "impact_on_wages": "Real wages stabilize after a lag as nominal wages rise with inflation.",
  "time_frame": "Short to medium run",
  "economic_context": "Persistent inflation with strong labor bargaining power or formal indexation."
}
