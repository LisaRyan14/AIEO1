This tightening of monetary policy helps to slow down economic activity, reducing the demand-pull component of inflation. Conversely, if inflation rates are low, the Fed might lower interest rates to encourage more borrowing and spending, thereby stimulating the economy. The interplay between these rates is critical in managing economic stability and growth.\n"

      "zero-shot response: Inflation significantly impacts interest rate decisions made by central banks and financial institutions. Here's how it works:\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. **Understanding Inflation**:\n",
      "   - **Inflation** is the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services is rising, leading to a decrease in purchasing power. It is typically measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or the Producer Price Index (PPI).\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. **Central Bank's Role**:\n",
      "   - Central banks, such as the Federal Reserve in the United States, aim to maintain price stability and support economic growth. They closely monitor inflation indicators to guide their monetary policy.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. **Interest Rates and Inflation Relationship**:\n",
      "   - **Nominal vs. Real Interest Rates**: The nominal interest rate is the rate before adjusting for inflation, while the real interest rate is adjusted for inflation. If inflation rises, the real interest rate (nominal rate - inflation rate) can decrease, which may lead central banks to adjust their policies.\n",
      "   - When inflation increases, it erodes the purchasing power of future cash flows and savings, prompting lenders to demand higher interest rates to compensate for this loss.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. **Decision-Making Process**:\n",
      "   - **Raising Rates**: In response to rising inflation, a central bank may increase interest rates to:\n",
      "     - Cool down the economy by making borrowing more expensive, which can reduce spending and investment.\n",
      "     - Signal a commitment to maintaining price stability.\n",
      "   - Higher rates can slow economic growth, but are often necessary to prevent inflation from spiraling out of control (hyperinflation).\n",
      "\n",
      "   - **Lowering Rates**: Conversely, if inflation is low or deflation (a decrease in overall prices) is a concern, central banks may lower interest rates to:\n",
      "     - Encourage borrowing and spending, aimed at stimulating economic growth.\n",
      "     - Avoid the negative effects of deflation, which can lead to reduced consumer spending and investment.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. **Market Expectations**:\n",
      "   - Central banks also consider market expectations of future inflation when making interest rate decisions. If the market anticipates rising inflation, central banks may preemptively raise rates to align actual rates with those expectations.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 6. **Interest Rate Policy Tools**:\n",
      "   - Central banks use various tools to manage interest rates, including:\n",
      "     - Setting the benchmark interest rate (e.g., the federal funds rate).\n",
      "     - Open market operations, which involve buying or selling government securities to influence liquidity and interest rates.\n",
      "     - Adjusting reserve requirements for banks.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 7. **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Effects**:\n",
      "   - Short-term inflation fluctuations might lead to quick rate adjustments, while more sustained inflation trends or economic changes might cause a reassessment of long-term monetary policy.\n",
      "\n",

       "To understand how the central bank's decision to increase the policy rate by 1.5 percentage points (pp) in response to 5% inflation affects real wages, we need to analyze the interaction between nominal wages, prices, and interest rates. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the situation:\n",
       "\n",
       "### 1. **Understanding Key Terms**\n",
       "   - **Nominal Wages:** The amount of money workers receive in current dollars, not adjusted for inflation.\n",
       "   - **Inflation Rate:** The rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services rises, eroding purchasing power.\n",
       "   - **Real Wages:** Nominal wages adjusted for inflation; this reflects the purchasing power of wages.\n",
       "   - **Policy Rate:** The interest rate set by the central bank, influencing borrowing costs and overall economic activity.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 2. **Initial Conditions**\n",
       "   - **Nominal Wage Growth**: 3%\n",
       "   - **Inflation Rate**: 5%\n",
       "   - **Central Bank Rate Increase**: 1.5 pp\n",
       "\n",
       "### 3. **Nominal Wage Growth vs. Inflation**\n",
       "   - As nominal wages increase by 3%, the prices of goods and services are rising at a faster rate of 5% due to inflation. This means that even though workers are earning more money nominally, the cost of living is increasing even more.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 4. **Calculating Real Wages**\n",
       "To find the real wage growth, we use the following formula:\n",
       "\n",
       "\\[\n",
       "\\text{Real Wage Growth} = \\text{Nominal Wage Growth} - \\text{Inflation Rate}\n",
       "\\]\n",
       "\n",
       "Plugging in the values:\n",
       "\n",
       "\\[\n",
       "\\text{Real Wage Growth} = 3\\% - 5\\% = -2\\%\n",
       "\\]\n",
       "\n",
       "### 5. **Interpreting the Results**\n",
       "- **Real Wages Decline**: The real wage growth is negative at -2%. This indicates that workers' purchasing power is effectively decreasing. Even though they are nominally earning more, they can buy less with their wages because the prices are rising faster than their wages.\n",
       "  \n",
       "### 6. **Impact of the Increased Policy Rate**\n",
       "- The central bank’s rate increase is typically aimed at controlling inflation by tightening monetary policy. Higher policy rates can lead to higher borrowing costs, which may slow down consumer spending and investment. \n",
       "- This slowdown in demand can potentially help reduce inflation in the long run, but in the short term, workers may feel the squeeze as their real wages decline.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 7. **Labor Market Dynamics**\n",
       "- With real wages falling, workers may feel less secure and less inclined to negotiate for wage increases, as the labor market may become more competitive. Employers might benefit from this if there’s no upward pressure on wages.\n",
       "- If inflation persists while nominal wage growth remains stagnant, workers may demand higher wages in the future, but achieving that will depend on various factors including labor market conditions and overall economic performance.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Summary\n",
       "In summary, the increase in the policy rate by 1.5 pp in response to 5% inflation, combined with 3% nominal wage growth, results in a decline in real wages by 2%. Consumers, reflecting this decrease in purchasing power, may reduce spending, which can further influence economic activity and potentially lead the central bank to reconsider its policy stance in the future."

    "- **Few-shot prompts** improve structure and reasoning consistency.  \n",
    "- **Reasoning models** (like GPT-5-reasoning) deliver more coherent causal explanations between inflation, interest rates, and growth indicators.  \n",
    "- **Non-reasoning models** (e.g., GPT-5-mini) provide faster, surface-level insights ideal for retrieval or summarization tasks.  \n",
    "- Future work could add **RAG pipelines** with real-time macroeconomic data or integrate with financial dashboards for live LLM reasoning visualization."
